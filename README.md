**Project:  Task Management Web App**

## Abstract:  
The main purpose of this project is to build out a front-end task management app with a fully functional todo list and contact form that use controlled components in React. The full project requirements can be found  [here](https://sites.google.com/view/reference-page/procject-3). 

## Workflow Requirements

### User Stories:

**1.** "As a student studying web development, I want a solution with a simple interface that can add, remove and update the completed status of todo list items."  
*- Daniel*

**2.** "As a user of both mobile and desktop applications, I want a light weight task management application that is available on both platforms as well as cross compatible on mobile devices."  
*- Mark*

**3.** "As a mobile user, I prefer progressive web apps for smaller applications because they don't need to be installed on my phone."  
*- Laura*

### Development Phase:

**1.** Created GitHub repository [https://github.com/mheerspink75/reactapp](https://github.com/mheerspink75/reactapp).

**2.** Added [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) and [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) to the project via npm.

**3.** Deployed production build to [GiHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) at url: [https://mheerspink75.github.io/reactapp/](https://mheerspink75.github.io/reactapp/) via [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) by following the process in this [video](https://youtu.be/517npPWIb8Q). The production site is hosted on the gh-pages branch of the repository [https://github.com/mheerspink75/reactapp/tree/gh-pages](https://github.com/mheerspink75/reactapp/tree/gh-pages).

**4.** Created Todo list code on [Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/todolistapp-29m9s) by following tutorials on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/mxK8b99iJTg), [Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-react-to-do-app-with-react-hooks-no-class-components) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-todo-list-with-react-hooks-ebaa4e3db3b/) focusing on the [React useState Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html). 

**5.** Added [Material-UI components](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/supported-components/) to the project and updated the code on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-todo-list-use-state-bewkb).

**6.** Added a contact form to the project by following a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/zT62eVxShsY) video on Youtbe.

**7.** Updated the [conctact form code](https://codesandbox.io/s/multi-step-contact-form-0n53k) and integrated the multistep form into a [Material-UI Dialog](https://material-ui.com/components/dialogs/) component.

**8.** Integrated the Todo List and Contact form into a [Material-UI responsive layout](https://codesandbox.io/s/7xdjq).

**9.** Updated the production build on GitHub through a combination of frequent commits to the main repository and using the [npm run deploy](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment) command, via gh-pages, on the gh-pages branch.

#### Future Improvements:

**1.** Server-side form validation was not required in this project. In the future I would like to work on further customization to the front-end and server-side validation.

**2.** Local storage was not required in this project. I would also like to integrate local storage.

**3.** In the future I would like to add more functionality to the project by integrating tables with search, pagination and sorting functionality.
